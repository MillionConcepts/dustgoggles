# dustgoggles
*a marslab project*


`dustgoggles` is a utility library for other modules in the *marslab* ecosystem. It contains 
a variety of text-parsing and data-structure-manipulating tools. They include Composition,
a flexible, antiformal algebraic pipeline-assembly system. This library does not contain 
discrete user-facing applications; if you're looking for something like a plotter or 
an image generator, you've found one of its dependencies.
